# Specs

Here we keep our products specifications. To keep stuff in order follow these rules:
* Use [squash and merge](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-pull-request-merges#squash-and-merge-your-pull-request-commits) for specification pull requests
* Update document version in each PR
* Use commits history to track changes
